### **9.1 Definition of Classical Planning**

**Classical Planning** involves devising a sequence of actions to transition from an initial state to a goal state in a well-defined environment. The key characteristics of classical planning are:

1. **Deterministic Environment:** Actions have known and predictable outcomes.
2. **Discrete States:** The environment is modeled using a set of discrete states.
3. **Well-defined Actions:** Actions are predefined, and their effects are deterministic.
4. **Goal State:** The planner seeks to reach a specific goal state from an initial state.

The goal of classical planning is to find a **plan**—a sequence of actions that will take the system from an initial state to a goal state. Classical planners do not need to account for uncertainty or partial observability, making them simpler but less general compared to more advanced planning methods.

### **9.2 Planning Algorithms as State Space Search**

In classical planning, **planning algorithms** often view the planning process as a **state space search**, where:

- **States** represent the configuration of the world at any point in time.
- **Actions** represent transitions between states.
- The objective is to find a sequence of actions (a plan) that leads from the **initial state** to the **goal state**.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **State Space Representation:**
    
    - The state space is typically represented as a **graph** where each node is a state, and each edge is an action that transitions between states.
    - The planner searches through the state space to find a path from the initial state to the goal state.
2. **Search Algorithms:**
    
    - **Uninformed Search:** Algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Depth-First Search (DFS)** can be used to explore the state space.
    - **Informed Search:** Heuristic search algorithms, such as **A* search**, can guide the search by estimating the cost of reaching the goal.

#### Example:

A robot needs to plan a series of movements to navigate a maze from a start position to an end position. The maze is modeled as a state space, and the robot’s movements are the actions that transition from one state to another.

### **9.3 Planning Graphs**

A **Planning Graph** is a data structure used to represent a planning problem over time. It is a layered graph where each layer corresponds to a state of the system at a particular time step.

- **Nodes in the Planning Graph** represent either **propositions** (facts about the world) or **actions** (actions that can be executed).
- **Edges** in the graph connect actions to the propositions that they affect, and propositions to actions that can be used to achieve them.

#### Key Features:

1. **Levels of the Graph:**
    
    - Each level represents either a set of propositions (states) or actions.
    - **Proposition Level (P):** Contains the facts that hold at that moment in time.
    - **Action Level (A):** Contains the actions that can be taken to achieve certain propositions.
2. **Relaxed Planning:**
    
    - A **relaxed plan** ignores the delete effects of actions (assuming actions do not negate previous actions), making it easier to find a valid sequence of actions.
3. **Use in Planning:**
    
    - **GraphPlan Algorithm:** One of the most famous algorithms that uses planning graphs to find a valid plan. It constructs the graph iteratively and searches for a solution.

#### Example:

Imagine you want to make a sandwich. The **Propositions** would include "Bread on Table," "Peanut Butter on Bread," and "Sandwich Ready." The **Actions** would include "Pick up bread," "Spread peanut butter," and "Place peanut butter on bread." The planning graph helps in structuring and organizing these steps.

### **9.4 Other Classical Planning Approaches**

Besides state-space search and planning graphs, there are other **classical planning techniques**, including:

1. **STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver):**
    
    - A formal language and method for representing actions and plans. Actions are represented with three parts: **preconditions** (what must be true before the action), **effects** (what changes after the action), and **delete lists** (which facts are negated).
    - STRIPS-based planners focus on finding sequences of actions to transition from the initial state to the goal.
2. **Partial Order Planning:**
    
    - In **partial order planning**, actions are not required to be ordered linearly. Instead, the planner defines a set of constraints on actions that must be respected, but the order in which actions occur is not strictly determined unless necessary.
    - It focuses on ordering the actions only when required, leading to potentially more efficient plans.
3. **Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning:**
    
    - HTN planning decomposes high-level tasks into smaller sub-tasks and plans at different levels of abstraction. It is suitable for tasks with a natural hierarchical structure.
    - HTNs are commonly used in complex domains like robotics, where a broad task (e.g., "clean the house") is broken down into more specific actions (e.g., "vacuum living room," "wash dishes").

### **9.5 Analysis of Planning Approaches**

Classical planning approaches differ in their trade-offs regarding **completeness**, **optimality**, **complexity**, and **flexibility**. Here’s an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of some key planning techniques:

1. **State-Space Search:**
    
    - **Advantages:** Simple to understand, can handle a wide variety of problems, and works well with small state spaces.
    - **Disadvantages:** Can become computationally expensive as the state space grows, leading to performance issues in large or complex domains.
2. **Planning Graphs:**
    
    - **Advantages:** Efficient representation of planning problems, helps detect inconsistencies early, and supports relaxed planning.
    - **Disadvantages:** Can be memory-intensive and may not always lead to the most efficient plan.
3. **STRIPS:**
    
    - **Advantages:** Well-established and widely used; simple to implement and provides a formal framework for action representations.
    - **Disadvantages:** Limited to deterministic environments and struggles with complex or partially observable environments.
4. **Partial Order Planning:**
    
    - **Advantages:** Flexible; avoids unnecessary ordering of actions and can potentially find shorter plans.
    - **Disadvantages:** May struggle with identifying interdependencies between actions in large, complex problems.
5. **HTN Planning:**
    
    - **Advantages:** Well-suited for tasks with clear hierarchical structures and allows more abstract reasoning.
    - **Disadvantages:** Can be difficult to formalize hierarchical tasks in complex domains; less suited for problems without inherent hierarchical structures.

### **Exercises**

1. **State-Space Search Exercise:**  
    Imagine a robot that needs to navigate from point A to point B in a grid. Define the initial state, the goal state, and describe the sequence of actions using state-space search. How would the robot use BFS or DFS to reach the goal?
    
2. **Planning Graph Exercise:**  
    Create a planning graph for a simple cooking recipe (e.g., making a cup of tea). Identify the propositions, actions, and their interdependencies.
    
3. **STRIPS Exercise:**  
    Define a STRIPS action schema for a robot to move from one room to another. Include the preconditions, effects, and delete lists for the action "Move" and any other relevant actions.
    
4. **Partial Order Planning Exercise:**  
    Given a set of tasks to organize a party (e.g., "send invitations," "buy cake," "decorate room," "buy drinks"), create a partial order plan for these tasks. How do you determine which tasks must occur before others, and which tasks can be done in any order?
    
5. **HTN Planning Exercise:**  
    Use HTN planning to break down the task "Make Dinner" into smaller tasks. What sub-tasks would you define, and how would you order them to make the process efficient?
